I see him! 
He, the noseless one, dares to mock my nose! 
How insolent! 
You say it's useless. That I know. 
But who fights believing that every 
battle will be a success? 
I fought for lost causes and fruitless 
quests! 
You there! I see you! Thousands of you! 
All enemies of mine, I know you now! 
Ah! There's Falsehood! 
And Compromise!
Prejudice!
Treachery!  
Will I surrender? Strike an agreement? 
Never! 
And there you are, Folly! 
I know you'll be the one to take me down, 
at last. 
Yet I'll fall fighting, fighting still!
You've stripped me of the laurel 
and the rose! 
Of glory and love!
Take it all! 
But there is still one thing I hold against you, 
and when I enter God's house tonight, 
I shall wave one thing in salutation, 
across heaven's blue threshold. 
For there is one thing I have left, 
void of smear or stain, 
and I take it with me despite you. 
And that is
My white plume.
